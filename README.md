# playertps
Simple TPS Plugin

This plugin is to enable players to use /ptps (like the original /tps spigot command) to see their TPS on a server of which this plugin
is installed on. I am new to GitHub and are still getting the swing of it. Though, i will be posting projects here to expand my knowledge
with Spigot API and Java.
